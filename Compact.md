# Team 01 Agreement

> ## Workflow
> #### Project Manager
> * Delegate the team throughout the assigned sprint duration
> * Mediate team discussions
> * Follow up with team members as frequently as needed
> * Implement leadership skills 
> * Make sure all sprint deliverables are met
> * Contact and update any absent member within 24 hours after class
> * Avoid micromanaging 
> ***
> #### Team
> * Respect each other
> * No Cyberbullying 
> * Any conflicts or concerns that can't be resolved by the project manager should be addressed to the professor
> * Assigned tasks should be completed on time
> * Perform assigned role diligently; if roles are hard to perform then discuss with team and professor 
> * Be punctual 
> * Inform team and the professor about absence as soon as possible, preferably the day before lab
> * Don't hesitate to ask for help
> * Don't hesitate to share your opinions 
> * Implement good teamwork 

********

> ## Communication
> #### Rules
> * Implement good listening and communication skills
> * Use "raise hand" to speak; avoid speaking over each other
> * Meetings are all virtual
> * Update the team on your deliverables 
> * Move your assigned tasks to "in progress" when started and "sprint 0X" once completed 
> * Reach out to PM/team for any help via Slack 
> * At least one meeting outside class 
> * Contact Professor via Slack under #general channel for any project related questions so team is informed as well 
> * Keep transparency; if you aren't able to get something done on time, inform the PM right away instead of making excuses
> *** 
> #### Channels
> * Github: Upload all relevant files here
> * Slack: Message the team, see github and trello updates, contact professor
> * Trello: Add, edit, review, adjust, submit Tasks for the entire project
> * Google meet: Scheduled meetings aside from lab

********

> ## Consequences 
> * Missing 1 lab = warning; catch up with PM/team
> * Missing 2 labs in a row without any updates = PM informs professor
> * Missing 3 labs in a row without any updates = Professor take action, team intervention
> * No response to PM follow up = warning; failure to follow team agreement. Must have deliverables done. 
> * No response to follow up and no deliverables 2 days before deadline: team interventation; PM assign missing deliverables to other members; professor will be informed 
> * Team will not accept more than 1 missing sprint deliverables; further actions will be taken as necessary according to class syllabus and professor's decision

*********

> ## Restoration 
> * PM increase follow up meeting/chat whenever needed 
> * Transparency with team to handle any conflicts; everyone is aware of what's happening with the project and for all roles included
> * Take on extra tasks as needed
> * Rigorous monitoring from PM as needed 
> * Request recommendation from professor as needed
